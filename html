        <h1>About</h1>
          <p>My name is Brandon Gabbard and I'm 36 yrs young.  I'm married to an angel named Brandy
            and we just had our 10yr wedding anniversary May 23, 2019, although we've been enjoying each others company for 18yrs.
            We have 3 great kids and a dog.  I live in Lawrenceburg, IN and I'm not going to lie...I don't like it here at all.
            I could also say I'm not a big fan of my current job as a 'Machine Repairman' but I am grateful for what it's provided
            for my family and most recently gave me motivation to learn 'WebDev'.  Brandon Gabbard - Web Developer, has a great ring
            to it don't you think?
              I also have a handful of hobbies such as weight-lifting, golfing, listening to music(except country), playing basketball,
              getting my heart broken from watching the Bengals, and one of my favorites is riding my 2015 Kawasaki Z1000.

        <h1>Family</h1>
          <section>Mi Familia...what can i that any other proud father wouldn't say?  My family is simply a one of a kind best.  We are almost
            always busy with school, sports, dance, girl scouts, and plays.  Our youngest isn't even is school yet either.  Speaking of
            youngest, lets talk children.

              <p><em>Braelyn Michelle</em>, aka 'Brae Brae' is 8 and was born on July 5th 2011.  She is the sweetest, most kind, and loving person I know.  She stays
            involved in activities year round and excels at school.  She looks like Daddy but definitly has Mommys personality.  Just like
          most kids nowadays she likes to play on her ipad and ride her bike.  I just bought her a new mountain bike she loves.  Her favorite food is pizza.
              </p>

              <p><em>Briella McKinley</em>, aka 'Breezy' is 5 and was born on January 8th 2014.  She is sweet, kind, and loving, when she wants to be lol.
                She is very independent and she is our most humurous kid, without even trying most of the time.  Now Breezy has Mommys looks and petite
                figure but according to Brandy, Breezy has my personality; which is a lot more mischievous and curious.  Her favorite food is donuts.
